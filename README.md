# Sept-Hybrid-Punnet-Square
This program creates the Sept hybrid punnet square.
## What is a Punnet square ?
The Punnett square is a square diagram that is used to predict the genotypes of a particular cross or breeding experiment. It is named after Reginald C. Punnett, who devised the approach in 1905.\
The diagram is used by biologists to determine the probability of an offspring having a particular genotype. The Punnett square is a tabular summary of possible combinations of maternal alleles with paternal alleles. These tables can be used to examine the genotypical outcome probabilities of the offspring of a single trait (allele), or when crossing multiple traits from the parents.\
The Punnett square is a visual representation of Mendelian inheritance. It is important to understand the terms "heterozygous", "homozygous", "double heterozygote" (or homozygote), "dominant allele" and "recessive allele" when using the Punnett square method. For multiple traits, using the "forked-line method" is typically much easier than the Punnett square. Phenotypes may be predicted with at least better-than-chance accuracy using a Punnett square, but the phenotype that may appear in the presence of a given genotype can in some instances be influenced by many other factors, as when polygenic inheritance and/or epigenetics are at work.
## What exactly is this program ?
This program basically follows the same principle of the [Di-hybrid square](http://www.biology.arizona.edu/mendelian_genetics/problem_sets/dihybrid_cross/03t.html)
but this program creates more than 8,000 unique offspring genes. The Di-Hybrid Punnet square is generally made with 2 of the contrasting characters of a pea plant. However a pea plan can have upto 7 different traits. So this creates just tha
## What about the Human Gene ?
Well a human chromosome is made of 2 Alleles and a gene has 2 pairs or 47 of chromosomes (1 for gender).This makes a single human gene have about 94 different alleles!\
The sept hybrid punnet square has 16,384 possible combinations. A human gene's punnet square will have 3.92 x 10^56 possible combinations. No computer in the world (as of 2022) is capable of pruducing and storing such high amounts of data. So its not possible(Yet).
